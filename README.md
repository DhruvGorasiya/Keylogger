# Keylogger

* Created a keylogger using Python which records the keystrokes of the user and sends it to the attacker
through email.

* Made the application work exactly like google chrome and hid the keylogger behind chrome application.
* 
* Application sends the email of every 100 saved keystrokes to the attacker and application cannot be
stopped unless computer shuts down or force stopped.
